After doing Tableau project Product Line Performance analysis, we can make next conclusions:
- The Central region is dominating sales with 57% of sales during this time period
- Sales performance started out as unstable, but the last 4 months have seen a steady increase in sales
- 5 salespeople are below the median sales rep performance for this period
- 2 salespeople are significantly low in terms of sales
- Binders and Pen Sets have sold the most over this time period
- Desks and Binders have the highest selling prices
- Desks have the highest selling price, but the lowest sales


Recommendations:

The low-performing sales reps should focus on Binder sales since they have the highest sales volume in this period and second highest price.

The finance team should dive into the variation in price per units between regions to see if there is anything that can be done to increase low-performing regions.
